    <details><summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
    Educators are increasingly concerned about the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT in programming education, particularly regarding the potential exploitation of imperfections in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) Detectors for academic misconduct. In this paper, we present an empirical study where the LLM is examined for its attempts to bypass detection by AIGC Detectors. This is achieved by generating code in response to a given question using different variants. We collected a dataset comprising 5,069 samples, with each sample consisting of a textual description of a coding problem and its corresponding human-written Python solution codes. These samples were obtained from various sources, including 80 from Quescol, 3,264 from Kaggle, and 1,725 from Leet-Code. From the dataset, we created 13 sets of code problem variant prompts, which were used to instruct ChatGPT to generate the outputs. Subsequently, we assessed the performance of five AIGC detectors. Our results demonstrate that existing AIGC Detectors perform poorly in distinguishing between human-written code and AI-generated code.

    <details><summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
   Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has garnered considerable attention for its impressive performance, with Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, emerging as a leading AIGC model that produces high-quality responses across various applications, including software development and maintenance. Despite its potential, the misuse of LLMs, especially in security and safety-critical domains, such as academic integrity and answering questions on Stack Overflow, poses significant concerns. Numerous AIGC detectors have been developed and evaluated on natural language data. However, their performance on code-related content generated by LLMs remains unexplored. To fill this gap, in this paper, we present an empirical study evaluating existing AIGC detectors in the software domain. We select three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5, WizardCoder and CodeLlama, for machine-content generation. We further created a comprehensive dataset including 2.23M samples comprising code-related content for each model, encompassing popular software activities like Q&A (150K), code summarization (1M), and code generation (1.1M). We evaluated thirteen AIGC detectors, comprising six commercial and seven open-source solutions, assessing their performance on this dataset. Our results indicate that AIGC detectors perform less on code-related data than natural language data. Fine-tuning can enhance detector performance, especially for content within the same domain; but generalization remains a challenge.

1. **ACW: Enhancing Traceability of AI-Generated Codes Based on Watermarking** (arXiv Aug 2024) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Watermarking-cyan) <br />

    <details><summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
    With the development of large language models, multiple AIs have become available for code generation (such as ChatGPT and StarCoder) and are adopted widely. It is often desirable to know whether a piece of code is generated by AI, and furthermore, which AI is the author. For instance, if a certain version of AI is known to generate vulnerable codes, it is particularly important to know the creator. Watermarking is broadly considered a promising solution and is successfully applied for identifying AI-generated text. However, existing efforts on watermarking AI-generated codes are far from ideal, and pose more challenges than watermarking general text due to limited flexibility and encoding space. In this work, we propose ACW (AI Code Watermarking), a novel method for watermarking AI-generated codes. The key idea of ACW is to selectively apply a set of carefully-designed semantic-preserving, idempotent code transformations, whose presence (or absence) allows us to determine the existence of watermarks. It is efficient as it requires no training or fine-tuning and works in a black-box manner. Our experimental results show that ACW is effective (i.e., achieving high accuracy on detecting AI-generated codes and extracting watermarks) as well as resilient, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

1. **Automatic Detection of LLM-generated Code: A Case Study of Claude 3 Haiku** (arXiv Sept 2024) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Analysis-green) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Machine_Learning-orange) <br />

    <details><summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
   Using Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained popularity among software developers for generating source code. However, the use of LLM-generated code can introduce risks of adding suboptimal, defective, and vulnerable code. This makes it necessary to devise methods for the accurate detection of LLM-generated code. Toward this goal, we perform a case study of Claude 3 Haiku (or Claude 3 for brevity) on CodeSearchNet dataset. We divide our analyses into two parts: function-level and class-level. We extract 22 software metric features, such as Code Lines and Cyclomatic Complexity, for each level of granularity. We then analyze code snippets generated by Claude 3 and their human-authored counterparts using the extracted features to understand how unique the code generated by Claude 3 is. In the following step, we use the unique characteristics of Claude 3-generated code to build Machine Learning (ML) models and identify which features of the code snippets make them more detectable by ML models. Our results indicate that Claude 3 tends to generate longer functions, but shorter classes than humans, and this characteristic can be used to detect Claude 3-generated code with ML models with 82% and 66% accuracies for function-level and class-level snippets, respectively.

1. **Uncovering LLM-Generated Code: A Zero-Shot Synthetic Code Detector via Code Rewriting** (arXiv May 2024) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Machine_Learning-orange) <br />
    *MTong Ye, Yangkai Du, Tengfei Ma, Lingfei Wu, Xuhong Zhang, Shouling Ji, Wenhai Wang*
    [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16133)]
    <details><summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
     Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency in generating code. However, the misuse of LLM-generated (Synthetic) code has prompted concerns within both educational and industrial domains, highlighting the imperative need for the development of synthetic code detectors. Existing methods for detecting LLM-generated content are primarily tailored for general text and often struggle with code content due to the distinct grammatical structure of programming languages and massive "low-entropy" tokens. Building upon this, our work proposes a novel zero-shot synthetic code detector based on the similarity between the code and its rewritten variants. Our method relies on the intuition that the differences between the LLM-rewritten and original codes tend to be smaller when the original code is synthetic. We utilize self-supervised contrastive learning to train a code similarity model and assess our approach on two synthetic code detection benchmarks. Our results demonstrate a notable enhancement over existing synthetic content detectors designed for general texts, with an improvement of 20.5% in the APPS benchmark and 29.1% in the MBPP benchmark.

    *Hing Pham, Huyen Ha, Van Tong, Dung Hoang, Duc Tran, Tuyen Ngoc LE*

    <details><summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
    The widespread use of virtual assistants (e.g., GPT4 and Gemini, etc.) by students in their academic assignments raises concerns about academic integrity. Consequently, various machine-generated text (MGT) detection methods, developed from metric-based and model-based approaches, were proposed and shown to be highly effective. The model-based MGT methods often encounter difficulties when dealing with source codes due to disparities in semantics compared to natural languages. Meanwhile, the efficacy of metric-based MGT methods on source codes has not been investigated. Moreover, the challenge of identifying machine-generated codes (MGC) has received less attention, and existing solutions demonstrate low accuracy and high false positive rates across diverse human-written codes. In this paper, we take into account both semantic features extracted from Large Language Models (LLMs) and the applicability of metrics (e.g., Log-Likelihood, Rank, Log-rank, etc.) for source code analysis. Concretely, we propose MageCode, a novel method for identifying machine-generated codes. MageCode utilizes the pre-trained model CodeT5+ to extract semantic features from source code inputs and incorporates metric-based techniques to enhance accuracy. In order to assess the proposed method, we introduce a new dataset comprising more than 45,000 code solutions generated by LLMs for programming problems. The solutions for these programming problems which were obtained from three advanced LLMs (GPT4, Gemini, and Code-bison-32k), were written in Python, Java, and C++. The evaluation of MageCode on this dataset demonstrates superior performance compared to existing baselines, achieving up to 98.46% accuracy while maintaining a low false positive rate of less than 1%.

    <details><summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
    The ubiquitous adoption of Large Language Generation Models (LLMs) in programming has highlighted the importance of distinguishing between human-written code and code generated by intelligent models. This paper specifically aims to distinguish ChatGPT-generated code from human-generated code. Our investigation reveals differences in programming style, technical level and readability between these two sources. Consequently, we develop a discriminative feature set for differentiation and evaluate its effectiveness through ablation experiments. In addition, we develop a dataset cleaning technique using temporal and spatial segmentation to mitigate dataset scarcity and ensure high quality, uncontaminated datasets. To further enrich the data resources, we apply "code transformation", "feature transformation" and "feature adaptation" techniques, generating a rich dataset of 100,000 lines of ChatGPT-generated code. The main contributions of our research include: proposing a discriminative feature set that yields high accuracy in distinguishing ChatGPT-generated code from human-authored code in binary classification tasks; devising methods for generating rich ChatGPT-generated code; and introducing a dataset cleansing strategy that extracts pristine, high-quality code datasets from open-source repositories, thereby achieving exceptional accuracy in code authorship attribution tasks.

    <details><summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
    Since the remarkable generation performance of large language models raised ethical and legal concerns, approaches to detect machine-generated text by embedding watermarks are being developed. However, we discover that the existing works fail to function appropriately in code generation tasks due to the task's nature of having low entropy. Extending a logit-modifying watermark method, we propose Selective WatErmarking via Entropy Thresholding (SWEET), which enhances detection ability and mitigates code quality degeneration by removing low-entropy segments at generating and detecting watermarks. Our experiments show that SWEET significantly improves code quality preservation while outperforming all baselines, including post-hoc detection methods, in detecting machine-generated code text.
