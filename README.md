## Papers related to generated code detection

Regarding the rising era of LLMs, it is become challenging to develop tools and approaches to detect generated contents. The application is various specially in the education field to attest the autorship of the student's works, in the scientific domain, etc. In this repository, we gather all papers related to generated text detection and specially on code detection.

The following repository will be structured as sub-folders following these topics :

    Educators are increasingly concerned about the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT in programming education, particularly regarding the potential exploitation of imperfections in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) Detectors for academic misconduct. In this paper, we present an empirical study where the LLM is examined for its attempts to bypass detection by AIGC Detectors. This is achieved by generating code in response to a given question using different variants. We collected a dataset comprising 5,069 samples, with each sample consisting of a textual description of a coding problem and its corresponding human-written Python solution codes. These samples were obtained from various sources, including 80 from Quescol, 3,264 from Kaggle, and 1,725 from Leet-Code. From the dataset, we created 13 sets of code problem variant prompts, which were used to instruct ChatGPT to generate the outputs. Subsequently, we assessed the performance of five AIGC detectors. Our results demonstrate that existing AIGC Detectors perform poorly in distinguishing between human-written code and AI-generated code.

    <details><summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
    The ubiquitous adoption of Large Language Generation Models (LLMs) in programming has highlighted the importance of distinguishing between human-written code and code generated by intelligent models. This paper specifically aims to distinguish ChatGPT-generated code from human-generated code. Our investigation reveals differences in programming style, technical level and readability between these two sources. Consequently, we develop a discriminative feature set for differentiation and evaluate its effectiveness through ablation experiments. In addition, we develop a dataset cleaning technique using temporal and spatial segmentation to mitigate dataset scarcity and ensure high quality, uncontaminated datasets. To further enrich the data resources, we apply "code transformation", "feature transformation" and "feature adaptation" techniques, generating a rich dataset of 100,000 lines of ChatGPT-generated code. The main contributions of our research include: proposing a discriminative feature set that yields high accuracy in distinguishing ChatGPT-generated code from human-authored code in binary classification tasks; devising methods for generating rich ChatGPT-generated code; and introducing a dataset cleansing strategy that extracts pristine, high-quality code datasets from open-source repositories, thereby achieving exceptional accuracy in code authorship attribution tasks.
